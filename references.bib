An association model is used to calculate the thermodynamic functions of mixing of liquid CuMg and MgNi alloys and the phase equilibria of the MgNi system.

@article{Zhou2007,
abstract = {The phase equilibria associated with the binary Cu-Mg system are analyzed by applying results from first-principles calculations to a general solution thermodynamics treatment. Differing from previously reported models, we employ a four-species association model for the liquid, while the terminal and intermediate solid phases are modeled as substitutional solutions with one or two sublattices, respectively. The zero-Kelvin enthalpies of formation for the intermediate compounds, CU2Mg-C15 (cF24) and CuMg2-C-b (oF48) are computed using the Vienna Ab-initio Simulation Package (VASP). The Gibbs free energy functions for the individual phases are evaluated, and the resulting binary phase diagram is presented over the full composition range. While the phase diagram we propose exhibits only modest deviation from previously reported models of phase equilibria, our treatment provides better agreement with experimental reports of heat capacity and enthalpy of mixing, indicating a more self-consistent thermodynamic description of this binary system.},

The targeted binary solid solutions include fcc, bcc, hcp phases in the Al-Cu, Al-Mg, and Cu-Mg systems. For the Al-Cu system, the present first-principles predictions are in good agreement with the experimental data and the CALculation of PHAse Diagram (CALPHAD) modeling results. For the Al-Mg and Cu-Mg systems, where the reliable experimental information is not available, it is expected that the presently predicted thermodynamic properties could yield a helpful insight into the phase stabilities in these two systems, in particular for the metastable phases.},
