@article{Feufel1995,
abstract = {Using different calorimeters, the following measurements have been carried out: (i) the determination of the integral enthalpy of mixing of binary liquid MgNi and ternary liquid CuMgNi alloys; (ii) the determination of the heat capacity of the intermetallic compounds CuMg2, Cu2Mg, Mg2Ni and MgNi2; (iii) the determination of the enthalpy of fusion of the intermetallic compounds CuMg2 and Cu2Mg. An association model is used to calculate the thermodynamic functions of mixing of liquid CuMg and MgNi alloys and the phase equilibria of the MgNi system. The thermodynamic functions of the liquid CuMgNi alloys are calculated using the model parameters of the base binary systems. ?? 1995.},

@article{Zhou2007,
abstract = {The phase equilibria associated with the binary Cu-Mg system are analyzed by applying results from first-principles calculations to a general solution thermodynamics treatment. Differing from previously reported models, we employ a four-species association model for the liquid, while the terminal and intermediate solid phases are modeled as substitutional solutions with one or two sublattices, respectively. The zero-Kelvin enthalpies of formation for the intermediate compounds, CU2Mg-C15 (cF24) and CuMg2-C-b (oF48) are computed using the Vienna Ab-initio Simulation Package (VASP). The Gibbs free energy functions for the individual phases are evaluated, and the resulting binary phase diagram is presented over the full composition range. While the phase diagram we propose exhibits only modest deviation from previously reported models of phase equilibria, our treatment provides better agreement with experimental reports of heat capacity and enthalpy of mixing, indicating a more self-consistent thermodynamic description of this binary system.},
